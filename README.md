# Blog App

[Deployed App](https://reactblogapp.firebaseapp.com/)

This is a basic blogging platform with a React client and a RESTful API done in node.  The project began with the client written for Stephen Grider's React course.  

Afterward, the ability to edit posts was added and I wrote the node backend.  Doing my own API allowed for more customization and was necessary for the edit and update routes.
